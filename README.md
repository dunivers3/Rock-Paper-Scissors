### How it's made:

> <strong>Tech used: <u>HTML</u>, <u>CSS</u>, <u>Javascript</u>. </br>
>
> Rock, paper, and scissors game is a simple fun game in which both the players have to make a rock, paper, or scissors. It has only two possible outcomes a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other player.
>
> The game is designed using JavaScript where a player will be playing against the computer. In total there will be 5 moves. The player has to choose one option among the rock, paper, and scissors. A random option will be generated from the computer’s side and the one who wins will get one point every time.

## Optimizations:

-   Add visual graphics for each play.
-   Make the game play between two players instead of the computer.

## Lessons learnt:

> This project is a great way of displaying how to tackle a big problem in small variations of solutions that all lead to the solving of the one big problem.
> Also, the project show how one problem can be solved in many different ways, and the author just needs to choose the most simplest and most convinient solution.
